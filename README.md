This is a subgroup of files from a single-page, partially real-time, fully asynchronic closed network web application.

A userguide is available with screenshots in the repository.

The application is capable of auditioning the process industrial equipment go through, mainly related to refineries.

Its main feature is the creation of complex task plans, which offer a way to stay updated in relation to the equipment being constructed/repaired as well as the human and machine resources being implemented in the (sub)tasks of said plans.

Secondary capabilities include the classic management of users, roles, employees, equipment, materials stock and a basic query interface for employee productivity (including graphs), along with an alert system for the users.

Another interesting feature is the way the application offers information to the company's clients through an alert system alongside a timeline, which shows the advances in the task plans.

This is a Single-Page, partially Real-Time, fully asynchronic web application.

Node was not a safe bet, but it sure was fun!
